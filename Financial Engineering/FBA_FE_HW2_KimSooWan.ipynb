    "Farmer D. Jones has a crop of grapefruit juice that will be ready for harvest and sale as 150, 000 pounds of grapefruit juice in 3 months. Jones is worried about possible price changes, so he is considering hedging. There is no futures contract for grapefruit juice, but there is a futures contract for orange juice. His son, Gavin, recently studied minimum-variance hedging and suggests it as a possible approach. Currently the spot prices are \\$1.20 per pound for orange juice and \\$1.50 per pound for grapefruit juice. The standard deviation of the prices of orange juice and grapefruit juice is about 20% per year, and the correlation coefficient between them is about .7. What is the minimum variance hedge for farmer Jones, and how effective is this hedge as compared to no hedge?"
